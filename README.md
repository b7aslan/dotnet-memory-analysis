# .NET Memory Analysis

This repository contains a series of examples and benchmarks that explore memory usage in .NET applications. Each scenario demonstrates how different coding patterns (e.g., using `string` vs `StringBuilder`, object allocation strategies, collection usage, etc.) affect memory consumption and garbage collection behavior.

The goal is to provide educational samples that help developers write more memory-efficient .NET code using tools like JetBrains dotMemory, Visual Studio Profiler, and other profiling utilities.
